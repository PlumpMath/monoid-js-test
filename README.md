# Cart Monoids

Here a simple cart implemented through monoids. Basically the monoids are in the price and in the product list.

The idea is that every product is inserted TTC in the cart.
Then the facture will show both the prices TTC and HT.

Actually is possible to do also the inverse, the only constraint (which is not coded atm) is that all the price must be represented the same way (all TTC or all HT).
